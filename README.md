# Item Manager App

* Lightweight App made with AngularJS. No more extra plugins and frameworks (no jQuery, no Bootstrap...) [2KB js, 10KB css]
* LESS preprocessor for CSS files
* Full responsive
* Simple and intuitive design to improve UI/UX

# Launch app

* Due to the CORS restrictions to open the JSON in local, I have set up a server in my directory launching this line in the terminal: php -S localhost:8000
